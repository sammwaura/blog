<h1>MOURATINA</h1>
<div class="container">
	

<p>Do you know that Muratina only just became legal in 2018? Yeah just hold on to that before I tell you more about it. It has only been a week since my fiancé and I became official. I cannot help but share my joy here with you. I am still in awe. I named the title as it is because, allow me to get candid with you. The day I met my fiancé he introduced himself as Mouraa. Well of course that is not his actual actual name but it is when you decide to twang the name Mwaura a bit, haha. He told me this and I laughed but ended up getting used to it over the years and I now use it once in a while. <br>
So why am I telling you this? Like I said we just recently became one so you can now easily refer to us as MouraTina. Don’t ask me, but my Big Ted tends to be creative. To be honest, I have never before been so anxious and happy at the same time in my life. So many people showed up for us. More than expected. In earlier years of my life I know that I have bestowed courage and bravery and have expressed so a couple of times but this no. I cannot explain the feeling. In this our Gikuyu culture the lady is only unveiled by her fiancé only later on after the guests have eaten and introduced themselves. This was after probably 2hours later after the visitor’s arrival. You might as well just call me Rapunzel. Because I was feeling locked away in a tower awaiting Big Ted.<br>
So there we were later on, lined up, covered in lesos. I could here the voices in the background. This was the moment everyone had been waiting for. They needed to know how well this man knew me and needed assurance that indeed they were giving away the right person. So, there I was I did not know what Big Ted was doing but I could hear whispers and lots of laughter. Big Ted was sniffing around and I could hear it, he was looking for my scent I wanted to laugh but I took a deep breath and decided to hold it and get my act together.<br>
I tipped him that I was going to be in a green leso. I had to. You know how men can sometimes be. They need to be reminded of things often. Yes, he unveiled me. Whew... The smile that was on my face you could tell how immensely happy I was. I mean. He took my hand and immediately the anxiety left and I flowed with his pace. We danced to the beat and the audience was filled with joy for this new couple. I mean we are beautiful and breathtaking, even you couldn’t help it. As I am dancing, I cannot help but stare at Big Ted. He was just there looking so handsome and chewable aargh. I wanted to pounce on him like a panda and tear him. Hahaha<br>
Fast-forward we later cut the cake, ate and drank together. We then had our photo session with friends and family. Guests left at their own pleasure. Now to the better part of the evening and now the second most important part of the occasion was the drinking of MURATINA or some now refer to as murats. My fiancé and parents had gotten the 20L mutungi of muratina and for me I thought it was not going to enough until now when I have taken time to understand the intended meaning behind the brewing and drinking of muratina in the agikuyu culture. Muratina was made to seal a union between the couple and it connected the ancestors and the living.<br>
In Judaism wine was used since way back until today. It is used for Holy communion and other spiritual events by Christians such as the last supper which the Jews celebrate to date. To even remember that that the first miracle of Jesus was changing water into wine. Jesus knew that for the wedding to end majestically and with spiritual blessings there had to be wine. This brings me back to muratina which was used in the same way. Muratina is made in gikuyu land because God blessed it with the ingredients necessary. And they therefore brewed it in special occasions because this was something that was given to them by God and was therefore a way giving thanks.<br>
Dear reader kindly allow me to enlighten you. Muratina was made to be drank during important ceremonies like inititions, birth ceremonies, ruracios and weddings. It was only drank by the elderly and the youth. Children were not to drink. A cup or two was enough. Just like wine comes from grapes and is simply just natural so is Muratina. Muratina was composed of sugarcane, honey, water and Muratina(the fruit). Each had its significance sugarcane when you look at it, it grows with rings around it which are very hard by the way and are in different sections. And therefore, when you bless your children with muratina you bless them to pass each stage of life, and to experience the sweetness of each stage of life. Because think about it if you skip a certain stage of life you could as well be bitter. Honey on the other hand as we know is made by bees. Well if you don’t know bees leave their nests early in the morning to go in search for nectar and they can go as far as 7km. can you imagine? Bees know the flowers to work with, they know which are poisonous. Even in all their quests the most important thing is that as far as they go bees never forget their home. Bees are also clever enough to know seasons. They know when it’s about to rain ant they got to make some honey for the rainy season. So, when it rains, they just be chilling indoors and reproducing haha. Fantastic right? A bee as small as it is enormously clever. And therefore, just like bees you are being blessed with wisdom and intuition in all stages of life, friends, careers, without falling into traps to be as hardworking as a bee and always remember to save your fortunes for a rainy day. That even as you venture through life and the goodness of it may you never forget where you come from. Wow. Isn’t that beautiful. For people to sit, drink and bless you like this, the thought really amuses me.<br>
Water also had its purpose. We know that the land cannot be fertile without rain. And that for land to be productive it has to rain. Plants get to yield and animals, humans and even organic matter in the soil thrive from the benefits. In relation to this you are simply being blessed with wealth. Wealth in terms of peace, health, knowledge and wisdom, children, material possessions. Water was simply directing these blessings on you and your family.<br>
I want to blow your mind and lastly tell you about the Murats fruit. They are fruits that we don’t harvest. When I say we I mean the kikuyus, because I am proud to be a member even if I don’t practically do this. You can’t go picking up the fruits from the tree. But when it falls you pick it up and then use it for its intended purpose. I know the question you have in mind? What if you harvest it? And want to use it? Well, if you want to harvest it, it can only be used in for leisure. A muratina fruit looks like a sausage and has many seeds inside. It falls on its own and its back hardens. It cannot be eaten by ants etc. So, may you grow old and not die prematurely, and even after you fall and pass may you have left offsprings because the seeds in the fruit signify that. I know you thought you were probably laugh and talk about the drunken us and blablabla. ha shock on you<br>
When I think about all these things and how they have been blessed upon my life I am yet to wonder how it is it really can be compared to scotch or rather alcohol? With all these blessings declared upon our lives haven’t we already received them? All we have to do is only work towards them and just basically do what we should like Big Ted keeps telling me. We are entitled to abundance and may we never forget that.<br>
